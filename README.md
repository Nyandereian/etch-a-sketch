# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a digital version of the old-skool etch-a-sketch toy.

By hovering your mouse over a pixel, the pixel will get a random colour.
When you often hover over the same pixels, their colours will become more
intense.

Use the 'New grid' button to create a clean grid with a custom number of pixels
rows and columns. (Number of rows = number of columns.)
